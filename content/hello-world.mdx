Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a 21-year-old BSCS student from the Philippines, passionate about bridging the gap between technology and agriculture. This blog will be my space to share my journey in full-stack development, explore innovative solutions in agriculture tech, and document my learning experiences.

## What's This About?

As a computer science student with a growing interest in agriculture technology, I'm excited to share my experiences, projects, and insights. From building smart systems to developing full-stack applications, I'll be documenting my journey and the lessons learned along the way. Whether you're a fellow student, tech enthusiast, or someone interested in agriculture innovation, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

## Testing Markdown Features

Here's some common Markdown features I'll be using in future posts:

### Headers
